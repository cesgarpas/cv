[CV Spanish Version](./es)

I am a Software Engineer and I have been working in the development, deployment and management of cloud projects based in microservices. My plan is to keep learning, expand my knowledge and meet people in the Software Engineering field to work with and grow professionally. I consider myself a proactive and adaptative person ready to accomplish whatever is required.
